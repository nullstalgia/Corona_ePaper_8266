## Software:

#### Without delta:

Home Assistant and ESPHome

ESPHome:

I used Google's Roboto Font.

[https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)

Home Assistant: 

- Need Coronavirus integration (included in newest updates)

- For temp. reading, need this in configuration.yaml

```
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      temperature:
        unit_of_measurement: 'Â°F'
        value_template: "{{ state_attr('weather.home', 'temperature') }}"
```

#### With delta:

Same as above, but including some Home Assistant addons, Node-RED and influxDB

In order to keep using ESPHome (and because it was easy-ish), I made Node-RED output to a sensor in Home Assistant.

Home Assistant:

- [https://github.com/zachowj/hass-node-red](https://github.com/zachowj/hass-node-red)  (can be installed via HACS or manually)

Node:

Influx: uses database named `corona`
